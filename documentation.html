                             only source about the lives of the most important artists of Florence: “The 
                             Lives of the most famous painters, sculptures and architects” of <span class="fut">Giorgio Vasari</span>, 
                             the eminent Renaissance historian.  The project has been developed in the
                              framework of the course <span class="fut">“Information Modelling and Web Technologies”</span>, held 
                              by Prof Vitali for the MA in “Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge” in 
                              the a. y. 2022/2023. </p><p>
                            The selection of these three artists, for the <span class="fut">"The Lives"</span> project was deliberate,
                             as their artistic journeys were interwoven in a way that showcased reciprocal
                              influence. Chronologically, Donatello holds the position of the earliest among
                               them. His groundbreaking work not only defined his era but also left an indelible
                                mark on the Florentine art scene. Donatello's innovative stylistic choices and 
                                his ability to infuse life into his sculptures set a precedent that would echo 
                                through the ages. </p><p>
                            One of the most significant aspects of this influence can be traced to Donatello's 
                            impact on <span class="fut">Andrea del Verrocchio</span>. Verrocchio, a renowned artist in his own right,
                             found himself under the artistic tutelage of Donatello. This association led to 
                             a profound stylistic evolution in Verrocchio's work. The legacy of Donatello's 
                             innovative techniques and artistic vision can be observed in Verrocchio's 
                             sculptures and paintings, showcasing the enduring power of artistic mentorship
                              and inspiration.
                            Perhaps the most illustrious testament to this artistic lineage is the fact that
                             Andrea del Verrocchio went on to become the master of Leonardo da Vinci. 
                             This mentorship paved the way for Leonardo's unparalleled artistic genius to 
                             flourish. The rich blend of knowledge, techniques, and inspiration passed down 
                             from <span class="fut">Donatello</span> to Verrocchio, and subsequently to Leonardo, showcases how the 
                             art of Florence during the Renaissance was an evolving, collaborative endeavor.
                              The culmination of these artistic influences in <span class="fut">Leonardo da Vinci</span>'s work is a
                               testament to the profound and lasting impact of these interconnected lives in
                                the realm of <span class="fut">art history</span>.</p>
                    <p>
                            The web application created for the project comprises a collection of HTML pages
                             that have been tailored using CSS stylesheets and brought to life through the 
                             incorporation of JavaScript scripts. Within this <span class="fut">digital realm</span>, certain integral
                              elements, have been crafted using predefined templates sourced from Bootstrap 
                              and other reputable origins. These templates, while rooted in established designs,
                               have undergone subtle refinements to align with our specific requirements and to
                               respect the distinctive stylistic characteristics of the historical era we seek to portray. 
                                The "issue" pages of the three artists are where the text takes place. <span class="fut">Metadata</span>
                                 is displayed using buttons designed to emphasize important individuals and locations, following the Text Encoding paradigm <persName> and <placeName>.
                            Upon clicking the button to highlight selected metadata, users will have the opportunity to 
                            access a comprehensive list of these elements, complete with corresponding Wikipedia links. 
                            This feature enhances hyperlink-based interoperability, enriching the user experience.</p><p>
                            Additionally, a search bar is integrated into the platform, enabling users to locate
                             specific strings within the text. All instances of the searched string will be highlighted 
                             and quantified for easy navigation and reference.  Besides the home and the text page,  <span class="fut">a map</span>
                              is also present in the site. This latter created with Leaflet, a leading open-source 
                              JavaScript library for interactive maps. It shows all the meaningful places mentioned in 
                              Vasari’s texts. Within the map, each marked location features a popup containing both the
                               manner in which that place is referenced (for instance, there may be places mentioned
                                multiple times in the text with varying descriptions) and a link to the specific texts 
                                in which it is mentioned. This design empowers users to seamlessly navigate the text

                            platform offering access to an expansive collection from European cultural institutions—showcase pages from Collenuccio's seminal works: the Apologues (Agenoria, Misopenes, 
                            Alithia, and Bombarda) and Lucian's Dialogues (De raptu Europae, Galene et Panope, and De Paradis iudicio), all penned in eloquent Latin.

                            chosen for their resemblance to the fonts of the original texts.Cinzel,
                             with its classic elegance, graces the titles, image descriptions, and even some functional parts like the navbar or metadata button. 
                             In contrast, Aquiline, renowned for 
                             its striking resemblance to historical handwritten scripts, brings the main text to life. An additional font that is Goudy Initialen,
                              ornamental in nature, <span class="fut">adorns the initials</span> of various
                              articles, further embedding the rich style of the period.

                        Every textual element has been meticulously curated. Texts are <span class="fut">justified</span>, reminiscent of traditional manuscript formatting, and a generous right margin enhances the genuine ambiance.
                        Distinctive features, such as captions and underlines emphasizing individuals and locations, emulate the accentuated words commonly found in historical documents. Furthermore,
                        in keeping with the original design, a decorative sidebar has been incorporated alongside each text. The titles, too, faithfully adhere to the authentic style, with their rich burgundy 
                        backdrop complemented by gilded lettering and ornate borders. 
                            
                            
                            A notable challenge was the limited visual representation in Collenuccio's original manuscripts. To overcome this, existing images 
                            were ingeniously adapted to appear as if they were hand-drawn, maintaining fidelity to a time devoid of photography. To further enhance 
                            their ornamental appeal and achieve a cohesive aesthetic, each image is framed with a resplendent golden border

                            A different approach has been the one for the representative images of the three artists. In this case, by mirroring his distinctive depiction 
                            from the original <span class="fut">manuscripts</span>, I dediced to adorn each artist's photo with a delicate circular leaf border. This frame seamlessly merges with th einitial 
                            letter of each text, crafted using the Goudy Initialen font, thereby faithfully emulating the aesthetic of the original manuscript.

                            of this movement: dynamism, revolution, and chaos. Specifically, my inspiration was derived from the painter, sculptor,
                             designer, and illustrator <span class="fut">Fortunato Depero</span>, as well as Marinetti himself. I considered some of Depero's works, with a 
                             particular focus on the graphics and typography of his renowned "Bolted Book." <br>

                             Discover
                             the inspirational
                             moodboard on Pinterest. 
                              <a href="https://www.pinterest.it/elizastuglik6798/renaissance/"><i class="fab fa-pinterest fa-2x"></i></a><br>

                             Regarding fonts, I selected <span class="fut">Square font</span> for the navbar, the metadata button, and the title on the homepage. This choice is reminiscent of the blocky 
                             lettering on Depero's book title, further emphasized by the background image on the homepage, which pays homage to Depero's book cover. 
                             For the main text, I opted for the <span class="fut">Sitka font</span>, mirroring the book's typography.

                        The actual title of the page, however, is set in Roboto. Rather than emphasizing the font itself, I focused on its effects. The first part of the title features letters
                        positioned differently from one another, creating a sense of randomness and dynamism. This is achieved using CSS transformations, giving each letter its unique position 
                        and orientation.

                            The second part of the title takes a different approach, emphasizing the typographical style of Futurism with shadows that add <span class="fut">depth and movement</span>. The overlapping technique, 
                            combined with the shadow effects, creates a sense of depth and motion characteristic of Futurist typographic style.

                            In essence, while Roboto, being faithful to the simplicity and linearity of Futurist fonts, serves as a straightforward font choice, the CSS styling amplifies the chaos and 
                            dynamism inherent in the Futurist style.

                             For the article layouts, I was once again influenced by the "Bolted Book." I partitioned the text into paragraphs of
                            varying sizes, each oriented differently, and adorned with uniquely dimensioned borders. These borders differ in 
                            their placement, sometimes framing the top and bottom, other times the left and right, all presented elegantly.

                            I've also played with the size and thickness of words, a typical Futuristic trait. As a result, the text exudes an essence of chaos 
                            and <span class="fut">non-linearity</span>.


                            I sought to accentuate these characteristics even more in the title, drawing inspiration from Depero's design for the 1928 Strega liqueur. 
                            From this and other Futurist works, I embraced the idea of crafting an irregular shape for the title, basing it on a zig-zag pattern and 
                            incorporating various colors.</p>

                           <p> Examining the <span class="fut">color palette</span>, black is undoubtedly the dominant shade. Black played a significant role in Futurism, especially during its early years. 
                            It symbolizes modernity, energy, and dynamism and is essential for creating contrast with other colors, emphasizing shapes. I've chosen a purely 
                            black background adorned with white lines radiating from a central point, producing a perspective and depth effect. This design invokes motion, three-dimensionality, 
                            and dynamism—core elements of Futurism. The remainder of the palette leans towards the Futurist inclination to use vibrant colors as a response to industrialization, 
                            breaking from the past and opposing naturalism. This sentiment is evident in Depero's works, such as his design for Strega liqueur, from which I derived the purple 
                            and green shades, while the orange is borrowed both from there and the <span class="fut">"Bolted Book."</span> The background colors for the texts and the navbar were inspired by
                             the standard text hues in Depero's book, reminiscent of the traditional Futurist manifesto backdrop.</p>

                            <p>
                             Throughout the page, I've experimented with dimensions and rotations—creating a non-linear title and utilizing shadows for the subtitle. 
                             To echo a quintessential Futurist feature, I incorporated the "mix-blend-mode" property into the title texts, alluding to the Futurist 
                             hallmark of overlapping and merging shapes and images.

                            Another noteworthy aspect is the presence of various <span class="fut">animations</span>: the title's letter movements, color-changing letters in the navbar upon hover, 
                            background animations 
                            for the metadata button, and the recurring "click" word across the page. The latter aims to evoke the Futurist's frequent use of onomatopoeias, 
                            intended to break tradition and depict modern reality, as seen in Marinetti's "Zang Tumb Tumb." The choice of the word "click" serves a dual
                             purpose: it's relevant in the web context and symbolizes modernity, reminiscent of computer interactions.
